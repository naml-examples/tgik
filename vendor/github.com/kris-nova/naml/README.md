# Not Another Markup Language.

Replace Kubernetes YAML with raw Go!

Say so long üëã to YAML and start using the Go üéâ programming language to represent and deploy applications with Kubernetes.

Kubernetes applications are complicated, so lets use a proper Turing complete language to reason about them.

‚úÖ Take advantage of all the lovely features of Go (Syntax highlighting, Cross compiling, Code generation, Documentation)

‚úÖ Test your code directly in local Kubernetes using [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind). Yes you can really deploy your applications to Kubernetes.

‚úÖ Get your application directly into Go instead of YAML and use it in controllers, operators, CRs/CRDs easily. Use the Go compiler to your advantage.

## Convert YAML to Go

```bash
cat deploy.yaml | naml codify > main.go
```

Turn existing YAML into formatted and syntactically correct Go that implements the `Deployable` interface.

```bash
mkdir out

# Get started quickly with all objects in a namespace
kubectl get all -n default -o yaml | naml codify > out/main.go

# Pipe multiple .yaml files to a single Application
cat deployment.yaml service.yaml | naml codify \
  --author-name="Charlie" \
  --author-email="<charlie@nivenly.com>" > out/main.go
```

Copy the generic [Makefile](https://github.com/kris-nova/naml/blob/main/out/Makefile) to the same directory as your `main.go`

```bash 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kris-nova/naml/main/out/Makefile -o out/Makefile
cd out
make
./app -o yaml
./app install 
./app uninstall
```

Use `make help` for more. Happy coding üéâ.

## Example Projects

There is a "repository" of examples to borrow/fork:

- [values](https://github.com/naml-examples/full/blob/main/app.go#L52-L79) example pattern to replace a large `Values.yaml` file.
- [simple](https://github.com/naml-examples/simple) quick and simple example.
- [examples](https://github.com/naml-examples) GitHub organization.


### The Deployable Interface

As long as there is a Go system that implements this interface it can be used with `naml`. See examples for how to include an implementation in your project.

```go
// Deployable is an interface that can be implemented
// for deployable applications.
type Deployable interface {

    // Install will attempt to install in Kubernetes
    Install(client *kubernetes.Clientset) error

    // Uninstall will attempt to uninstall in Kubernetes
    Uninstall(client *kubernetes.Clientset) error

    // Meta returns the Kubernetes native ObjectMeta which is used to manage applications with naml.
    Meta() *metav1.ObjectMeta

    // Description returns the application description
    Description() string

    // Objects will return the runtime objects defined for each application
    Objects() []runtime.Object
}
```

In order to get the raw Kubernetes objects in Go without installing them anywhere, you pass in `nil` in place of an authenticated Kubernetes `Clientset`. 

Then you can access the objects in memory.

```go
    app.Install(nil)
    objects := app.Objects()
```

## Nothing fancy

Feel free to fork this repository and begin using it for your team. There isn't anything special here. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ We use the same client the rest of Kubernetes does.

 ‚ùé No new complex tools.

 ‚ùé No charts.

 ‚ùé No templating at runtime.

 ‚ùé No vague error messages.
 
 ‚ùé No more YAML guessing/checking.

 ‚úÖ Just Go. üéâ

## Features

‚ú® There is not a single `.yaml` file in this entire repository. ‚ú®

 - Express applications in üéâ Go instead of YAML.
 - Use the Go compiler to check your syntax.
 - Write **real tests** ü§ì using Go to check and validate your deployments.
 - Test your applications in Kubernetes using [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind).
 - Define custom installation logic. What happens if it fails? What about logical concerns at runtime?
 - Define custom application registries. Multiple apps of the same flavor? No problem.
 - Use the latest client (the same client the rest of Kubernetes uses).
